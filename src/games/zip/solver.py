def solve_zip_puzzle(cell_map, walls_map, grid_size):
    """
    Solves the Zip puzzle using depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking.

    Rules:
        - Each cell must be visited exactly once (Hamiltonian path).
        - The path must begin at the cell labeled "1" and end at the cell with the highest number.
        - Movement between adjacent cells is allowed unless blocked by a wall.
        - If a cell contains a digit, it must be visited in strictly increasing numeric order.

    Args:
        cell_map (dict): Maps (row, col) to either a digit (str) or "empty".
        walls_map (dict): Maps ((r1, c1), (r2, c2)) â†’ bool indicating wall presence (True = wall).
        grid_size (tuple): (num_rows, num_cols)

    Returns:
        list[(row, col)]: Ordered list of cell positions representing the valid path, or [] if unsolvable.
